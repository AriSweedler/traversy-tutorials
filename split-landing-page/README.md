This seemed like a pretty cool project, so I wanted to make it. Doing anything
major in CSS always feels kinda hacky to me, but the results are incredible!!
I pretty much followed him exactly, except that I changed the pictures and
colors.

The only technical difference I made, was the following: When you hover-left,
I moved the yPos of the left background image down a little bit instead of not
doing anything, This gives the effect of zooming in above the center instead
of zooming in on the center, when the image width increases. I did this so I'd
zoom in on my head, instead of on my body. I've commented above the CSS line.

Also, I added a favicon to my "site", thanks to [this](http://www.dwuser.com/education/content/quick-tip-adding-a-favicon-to-your-website/) website. Pretty
neat!! I think it turned out really well. Making stuff look good is so easy,
if you just realize how much power you're given by the "HTML/CSS STL"!!!
